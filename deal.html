    <h2 class="section-title">How to Deal with Physical Burnout</h2>
    <div class="strategy-content-text">
        <p>Physical burnout needs real recovery — not pushing through pain or exhaustion. Focus on rest, healing, and gradually rebuilding your strength.</p>
        <ul class="strategy-list">
            <li><strong>Rest fully:</strong> Pause or reduce activities causing strain. Your body needs true recovery time, not just lighter work.</li>
            <li><strong>Improve sleep habits:</strong> Keep a steady sleep schedule and seek help if you struggle with poor or non-restorative sleep.</li>
            <li><strong>Eat and hydrate well:</strong> Get enough calories, protein, and fluids. If appetite stays low, talk to a healthcare provider.</li>
            <li><strong>Return slowly:</strong> When you start feeling better, increase your workload or activity gradually and listen to your body.</li>
            <li><strong>Manage pain safely:</strong> Follow evidence-based treatments, avoid masking serious issues with excessive medication.</li>

    <h2 class="section-title">How to Deal with Work Burnout</h2>
    <div class="strategy-content-text">
        <p>Work burnout happens when your job takes more energy than it gives back. It's not weakness, it's a sign you've been under pressure for too long. The goal now is to pause, rest, and rebuild a healthier balance.</p>
        <ul class="strategy-list">
            <li><strong>Rebalance your workload:</strong> Reduce or space out tasks when possible. Talk with your manager about priorities or deadlines to avoid constant overload.</li>
            <li><strong>Set boundaries:</strong> Avoid working after hours or checking emails late at night. Protect your rest time so your mind can fully switch off.</li>
            <li><strong>Redefine success:</strong> Perfection isn't sustainable. Focus on progress and small achievements instead of expecting flawless results every day.</li>
            <li><strong>Take breaks:</strong> Short pauses during work like stretching, stepping outside, or breathing, refresh focus and prevent exhaustion.</li>
            <li><strong>Reconnect with purpose:</strong> Remember what makes your work meaningful. Reflecting on purpose helps rebuild motivation and perspective.</li>
            <li><strong>Seek support:</strong> Talk to coworkers, mentors, or professionals. Sharing how you feel helps you recover faster and feel less alone.</li>

    <div class="strategy-content-text">
        <p>Social burnout happens when constant interaction, pressure to stay connected, or emotional demands leave you feeling drained. It's not that you don't care, it's that your social battery needs recharging.</p>
        <ul class="strategy-list">
            <li><strong>Take a step back:</strong> It's okay to say no. Give yourself quiet time away from social activities or messages without feeling guilty. Solitude helps you reset.</li>
            <li><strong>Reconnect slowly:</strong> When you feel ready, spend time with people who make you feel calm, understood, and accepted, not drained or pressured.</li>
            <li><strong>Set boundaries:</strong> You don't have to reply instantly or attend every event. Protect your personal space and energy, both online and offline.</li>
            <li><strong>Prioritize quality:</strong> Meaningful, smaller connections often restore energy better than constant large-group socializing. Focus on what feels real and safe.</li>
            <li><strong>Practice self-reflection:</strong> Ask yourself what kind of interactions nourish you versus what leaves you tired. Understanding this helps prevent future burnout.</li>
            <li><strong>Seek support:</strong> If social exhaustion feels overwhelming or isolating, consider talking to a counselor or therapist for guidance and coping tools.</li>

        <ul class="strategy-list">
